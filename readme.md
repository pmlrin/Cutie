# Theme Cutie

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/yz-hs/PicGo/intro4.png)

## Background

In order to learn relevant knowledge and make a good-looking theme, I made this. The layout of the theme is like [handsome](https://www.ihewro.com/archives/489/), a typecho theme. Most of the codes were originally programmed by me, while the rest were from the Internet, for instance, [mkBlog](https://mkblog.cn/).

## Install

You can install it by running this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yurchiu/cutie.git
```

## Usage

Firstly, you need to set the value of `theme` in the blog configuration file (`/path-to-your-blog/_config.yml`) to `cutie` to enable this theme.

Then, you need to read documents to further configure the theme and learn more about this theme. Most of them are in Chinese.
